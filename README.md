## Introduction

Welcome to the Chatbot Project developed by Ujjwal Sharma as part of a challenge from the Orangewood Company. This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive chatbot that engages in natural conversations with users. The chatbot is designed to provide intelligent and contextually relevant responses to user inputs.

## Features

- **Conversational Flow:** The chatbot engages in natural conversations, understanding context and providing relevant responses based on previous messages.
- **Dynamic UI:** The Next.js framework enables a dynamic user interface that updates in real-time as the conversation progresses.
- **Responsive Design:** The chatbot interface is designed using Tailwind CSS to ensure seamless functionality across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Intelligent Responses:** Leveraging the OpenAI API, the chatbot generates responses that closely resemble human language, enhancing the user experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **API:** OpenAI API
- **HTTP Requests:** Axios
